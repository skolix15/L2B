"Convert a linear problem to a binary one"

The current project receives as an input a .txt file with a linear problem (formatted specifically - check the file named as LP-1.txt in order to see the format) 
and after processing the given problem, converts it into a binary one (check the proper binary format in the LP-2.txt file).
